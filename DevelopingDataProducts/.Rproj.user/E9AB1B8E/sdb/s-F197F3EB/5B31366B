General idea\n\n- The general idea of the Shiny application is to predict the breaking distance for a hypothetical 1920's car based on its speed.\n- The dataset used is called \"cars\" and it's a R default package.\n- The data give the speed of cars and the distances taken to stop. The data were recorded in the 1920s, so that's why our model is for a 1920's car. :-)\n\n--- .class #id \n\n## 3. The dataset\n\nHere's a summary of the dataset. It has 50 observations on 2 variables.\n\n```{r}\ndata(cars)\ndim(cars)\nsummary(cars)\n```\n\n--- .class #id \n\n## 4. Plotting the observations\n\nIn the Shiny app there's this plot of the observations.\n\n```{r}\nplot(cars, xlab = \"Speed (mph)\", ylab = \"Stopping distance (ft)\", las = 1, xlim = c(0, 25))\n```\n\n--- .class #id \n\n## 5. Linear Model and predicting\n\nI created a Linear Model based on the data:\n\n```{r, results='hide'}\nfm <- lm(dist ~ speed, data = cars)\n```\n\nUsing it it's simple to predict a breaking distance giving the speed (23 mph, for example):\n\n```{r}\npredict(fm, data.frame(speed = 23))\n```\n\nAccording to our model a car at 23 mph would take 72.87 feet to stop.\n\nA very basic machine learning!\n\nThank you!",
